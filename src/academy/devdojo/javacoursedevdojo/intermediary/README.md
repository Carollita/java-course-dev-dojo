- **State:** represents the data (value) of an object.

- **Behavior:** represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.

- **Identity:** An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

#### What is a class in Java:

A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
