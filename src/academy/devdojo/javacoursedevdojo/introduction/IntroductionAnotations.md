### How Java Works

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** = JVM is the runtime engine of the Java Platform, which allows any program written in Java or other language compiled into Java bytecode to run on any computer that has a native JVM. The JVM is specific to each OS.

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** = The JDK has a JVM, a compiler and debugging tools. It is used for development.

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** = The JRE is just for executing.

We will compile the `.java` source file and turn it into a `.class` file. This `.class` we call byteCode that will be executed by the JVM. The JVM will interpret and worry about working with the OS.
